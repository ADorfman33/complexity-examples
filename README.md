#Simple Complexity Examples

These programs don't do anything very interesting, but they do cost different 
amounts of time to run.

The programs in increasing order of cost are:
* `log.cpp`
* `sqrt.cpp`
* `linear.cpp`
* `quadratic.cpp`

Compile a file with the command

    g++ file.cpp

Time it by changing the value in the file `input` and running

    time ./a.out < input

Be careful not to run `quadratic.cpp` with too large a value!
